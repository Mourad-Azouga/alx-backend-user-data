### What is personally identifiable information (PII)?
PII is often referenced by US government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Yet the US lacks one overriding law about PII, so your understanding of PII may differ depending on your particular situation.  

The most common definition is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

### What pieces of information are considered PII?
According to NIST, PII can be divided into two categories: linked and linkable information.

Linked information is more direct. It could include any personal detail that can be used to identify an individual. Examples of this kind of PII include:

Full name
Home address
Email address
Social security number
Passport number
Driver’s license number
Credit card numbers
Date of birth
Telephone number
Owned properties e.g. vehicle identification number (VIN) 
Login details
Processor or device serial number* 
Media access control (MAC)*
Internet Protocol (IP) address*
Device IDs*  
Cookies*

Linkable information is indirect and on its own may not be able to identify a person, but when combined with another piece of information could identify, trace or locate a person. 

Here are some examples of PII that can be considered linkable information:

First or last name (if common)
Country, state, city, zip code
Gender
Race
Non-specific age (e.g. 30-40 instead of 30)
Job position and workplace

### What is non-PII?
Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is data that cannot be used on its own to trace, or identify a person.Examples of non-PII include, but are not limited to:

Aggregated statistics on the use of product / service
Partially or fully masked IP addresses
However, the classification of PII and non-PII is vague. Moreover, NIST doesn’t reference cookie IDs and device IDs, so many AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers consider them as non-PII. As we’ll see, this is in contrast to the definition of personal data, which treats such digital tackers as information that could identify an individual.

### What is personal data?
Personal data is a legal term that the GDPR defines as the following:

Article 4(1):

‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

This definition applies not only to a person’s name and surname, but to details that could identify that person. That’s the case when, for instance, you’re able to identify a visitor returning to your website with the help of a cookie or login information.
